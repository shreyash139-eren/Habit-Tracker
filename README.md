# Habit-Hole

     Habit-Hole is a habit tracker made for users to track their habits throughtout their journer.

         Started with creating the login and signup pages and for athentication, used Firebase for authentication and also for storing the data. Added some animations, which I found on Instagram posts and saved for future use.


         After started working on the Introductory page, added a dummy users count using Interval to give it an animation and added some pictures for my functions and texts explaining the purpose of the website and what features the users will get. At the end of the introductory page added a footer, in which I provided some of my social media contact informations.


         After the introductory page I started working on dashboard, was not sure about the UI so, I gave it a basic look and started working on different fuctionalities. Added a reward section to keep the users motivated and filled it with some random good stuffs and on every successful streak the users will get a coin and they coin use it to redeem the rewards. Added a focus timer section where users can use the timer and can do their chores and added some music videos from youtube which boosts focus and concerntration, so the users feel no need to leave the platform. Added a Community challenge section where users can participate in a community habit challenge and three random users who'll complete the task will be chosen for grand prizes.
        
        After that one day went solving some bugs which were appearing pretty frequently.

        After that I worked on the UI for more than 1 and a half day to make it kind of good looking, so the users can have a handsome looking page but ended up with the current one, took some help from chatgpt for animation for the dashboards main page and got some more out from ChatGpt and I added everything I liked, I'm still figuring out two or more things but noe the UI look much better than before.

        Used LocalStorage to persist theme and the data if the user is offline so whenever the user goes online everything he added or deleted will be sent to firebase and will get updated.
